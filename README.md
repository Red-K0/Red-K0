<h1 align="left"> Welcome to my profile </h1>
<p align="left"> If you're here, you're either interested in my work, or something went wrong with my work. Either way, you can contact me via my profile here, I'll check it when I can. </p>
<p align="left"> I'm a mostly self-taught programmer, although I have some professional experience in the field. And this profile servers to host some of my more hobby-like projects, such as a useful map of the C code page which can found <a href="https://github.com/Red-K0/C-Code_Page-Map">here</a>, or more complex projects such as my VT_Sequences library <a href="https://github.com/Red-K0/VT_Sequences">here</a>. </p>
<p align="left"> A lot of my projects are written in C#, but I also use C++ in a relatively equal capacity, only professionally. I have some experience with other languages such as Java and JavaScript, but not to the same degree. I'm primarily experienced in backend work, and have experience in web-related development as well, though little experience in frontend/GUI projects. </p>
